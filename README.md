Bemify is a set of Sass mixins to help you write well-structured, readable, maintainable, component-based modular SCSS source using a BEM-style syntax.

__Bemify site & documentation: [http://franzheidl.github.io/bemify/](http://franzheidl.github.io/bemify/)__

Bemify supports [libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass) since libsass 3.2.4.
## Install

Bemify can be installed as a [Ruby Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bemify), via [Bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=bemify), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bemify), or manually. As a NPM module, bemify supports [eyeglass](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass). Bemify is also on [Sache.in](http://www.sache.in/search?query=bemify).


### Bower
To install via bower run:

    $ bower install bemify --save-dev

### Ruby Gem
When installed as a Ruby Gem, Bemify will be installed as a Compass extension if Compass is installed on your system.

    $ gem install bemify

### npm
To install via npm run:

    $npm install bemify --save-dev

### Manual Install
Include `sass/_bemify.scss`in the appropriate location in your project.



## Usage
First, import bemify:

    @import 'bemify';


Once imported, the bemify mixins can now be used to write BEM-style SCSS, making your source cleaner and easier to read and change.

    @include block('my-element') {
        …

        @include element('child') {
          …
        }

        @include modifier('small') {
          …
        }

        @include modifier('large') {
          …
        }

        @include state('active') {
          …
        }

    }

The output will be full, non-nested BEM-style class selectors:


    .my-element {
      …
    }

    .my-element__child {
      …
    }

    .my-element--large {
      …
    }

    .my-element.is-active {
      …
    }

By default, bemify will output combined `.block.state` / `.block__element.state` selectors.
Bemify can also be configured to output full `.block--state` / `.block__element--state` selectors.
For details, see Configuration below.


The mixins can be nested to create modifiers for subcomponents:

    @include block('my-element') {

        @include element('child') {
            …
            @include modifier('bad') {
                …
                @include state('happy') {
                    …
                }
            }
        }

        @include modifier('large') {
            …
        }

        @include state('active') {
            …
        }

    }

This will result in:

    .my-element {
        …
    }

    .my-element__child {
        …
    }

    .my-element__child--bad {
        …
    }

    .my-element__child--bad.is-happy {
        …
    }

    .my-element--large {
        …
    }

    .my-element.is-active {

    }

### Scoping

Bemify can of course also be used inside any scope:

	.scope {

		@include block('nav') {

			// etc.

		}

	}


### Configuration Options

bemify uses some configuration variables where to adjust the block-element and the state separator, as well as the state prefix.
To overwrite bemify's config with your own configuration file, just import your variables before using one of the mixins.

    @import "your-variables";
    @import "bemify";

    @include block('my-block') {
        …
    }


Configurable options and their defaults are:

* `$combined-state-selectors`: `true`

  Will output selectors like: .element.is-active, set to false to write .element--is-active

* `$element-separator`: `__`

* `$modifier-separator`: `--`

* `$state-prefix`: `is`

  Note that `$state-prefix` can be overridden with each call to the `state` mixin, so you can use both `--is-active` and `--has-error` using the same configuration:

      @include state('error', 'has') {}


## Aliases
Not everyone thinks in the categories of 'block, element, modifier', but many of us still want to write modularized, components-based CSS. There are a couple of aliases included for those who think in terms of components, parent-child / -subcomponents included (And it's totally straightforward to add your own):

    @include block('name') {}
        == @include component('name') {}

    @include element('name') {}
        == @include child('name') {}
        == @include subcomponent('name') {}
        == @include sub('name') {}
